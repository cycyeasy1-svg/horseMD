## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Top-bar `+` button to create a new file, and a GitHub link in the status bar.
- Plain-text files (`.txt`) open in a fast plain-text editor instead of the
  Markdown WYSIWYG.
- macOS packaging (dmg + zip) and a native macOS title-bar layout.
- Bilingual README (English + 简体中文) with screenshots and a theme gallery; `CLAUDE.md`.
- MIT `LICENSE`, CI build check + tag-triggered release packaging, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, and issue templates.
- Explicit Electron security flags (`contextIsolation`, `nodeIntegration`) and a navigation guard.

### Fixed
- Status-bar theme/language menus were clipped by `overflow:hidden` and looked
  unclickable — they now open correctly.
- Large `.txt` files no longer hang the editor (they bypass Markdown parsing).
- Rename now preselects the filename without its extension, like new-file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Initial release: tabbed, Typora-style WYSIWYG Markdown editor.
- Folder workspace with file-tree sidebar, command palette, outline panel.
- Dark/light themes, session restore, single-instance file association.
- Windows NSIS installer and macOS dmg/zip packaging.
