# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Raw HTML tables now render as tables** (like Typora). An HTML `<table>…</table>`
  written in the Markdown is shown as a real, theme-styled table instead of
  escaped source. The Markdown source is unchanged — it round-trips and saves as
  the original HTML (rendering is display-only; `<script>`/inline event handlers
  are stripped).

### Performance
- **Faster startup / session restore.** Restored tabs now mount their rich
  editor lazily — only the active document spins up an editor on launch instead
  of every restored tab parsing its whole document at once. Editors stay mounted
  after first activation, so tab switches remain instant.
- **Smoother typing in large documents.** The floating block-level badge now
  coalesces its layout measurements to one per animation frame (it previously
  forced a synchronous reflow on every caret move / keystroke), and the
  selection-toolbar observer only re-scans when DOM nodes are actually added
  (debounced per frame) instead of on every edit.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- File tree: **drag and drop** files/folders into another folder to move them.
- File tree: the collapse-all button now **toggles** between collapse-all and
  expand-all (recursively expands every subfolder), with a matching icon.
- Selection toolbar buttons now show **tooltips** (Bold, Italic, Strikethrough,
  Inline code, Link).
- Always-visible **collapse / expand sidebar** toggle in the activity bar (the
  icon flips to an "expand" affordance when collapsed).

### Changed
- File-tree typography: larger, non-uppercase folder-name header and slightly
  larger row text for better legibility (especially CJK names).

### Fixed
- **Find (Ctrl+F) rewritten** to search only the editor content via the CSS
  Custom Highlight API: it no longer matches the text typed in the find box, and
  next/previous are instant (no IPC round-trip). Shows a live `x/total` count.
- **Uninstall no longer deletes user files.** The uninstaller now removes only
  the files HorseMD installed, so a document saved inside the install folder
  (e.g. a Markdown note next to the app) is preserved instead of being wiped by
  a blanket recursive delete. The install location is also fixed to a dedicated
  per-user folder so the app can't be installed into a folder of your own files.
- The title bar always keeps a draggable area to move the window, even when many
  open tabs fill the whole tab strip.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Floating **block-level badge** that tracks the caret, naming the current block
  (H1…H6 / 正文) beside the text.
- Sidebar right-click: **Duplicate** a file, and **Export as PDF**.
- Custom Windows caption buttons (minimize / maximize / close) with hover states
  (close turns red), replacing the native overlay.
- Explorer **"Open with HorseMD"** entry on folders — opens a directory as a
  workspace; the app now accepts a folder path on launch.
- **Notify-only update check**: on launch, looks up the latest GitHub release and
  shows a dismissible "new version available" toast.
- Inline **confirm (✓) / cancel (✗)** buttons on the create & rename fields, and
  an "empty folder" hint when an expanded directory has nothing to list.

### Changed
- Source/rich toggle now **keeps the scroll position** and no longer rebuilds the
  background editors, so switching is much faster.
- Shorter executable description ("HorseMD Markdown Editor") so the Explorer
  "Open with" name isn't a long sentence.

### Fixed
- New file/folder creation now commits on blur (clicking away no longer loses the
  typed name).
- The unsaved-close confirm dialog and a couple of error messages are now
  localized (zh/en).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- Open files now reliably auto-refresh when changed by another program: the
  single-file watcher polls (surviving "atomic replace" saves used by many
  editors/tools), and the editor remounts on reload so the new content actually
  shows.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- Export the current document to **PDF** (File → Export as PDF…, `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E`,
  or the command palette). Renders a clean, print-styled copy without editor
  chrome (code-block toolbar, table handles, etc.).

### Changed
- Writing font in the editor now matches the website — a sans-serif stack
  (Helvetica Neue / PingFang SC …) instead of the previous serif.
- Status bar now keeps the right-side controls (block/source toggles, theme,
  language, GitHub) fixed and visible when the window narrows — the file path
  collapses (ellipsis) instead of the buttons being hidden or pushed off-screen.

### Fixed
- New-file naming overwrote the input when typing digits (the name was reselected
  on every keystroke) — the name is now preselected once.
- Editor placeholder now follows a language switch live (was baked in at create).
- Opening a moved/deleted file no longer dumps a raw IPC error — the dead entry
  is removed from Recent with a friendly message; session restore skips missing
  files silently.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Top-bar `+` button to create a new file, and a GitHub link in the status bar.
- Plain-text files (`.txt`) open in a fast plain-text editor instead of the
  Markdown WYSIWYG.
- macOS packaging (dmg + zip) and a native macOS title-bar layout.
- Bilingual README (English + 简体中文) with screenshots and a theme gallery; `CLAUDE.md`.
- MIT `LICENSE`, CI build check + tag-triggered release packaging, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, and issue templates.
- Explicit Electron security flags (`contextIsolation`, `nodeIntegration`) and a navigation guard.

### Fixed
- Status-bar theme/language menus were clipped by `overflow:hidden` and looked
  unclickable — they now open correctly.
- Large `.txt` files no longer hang the editor (they bypass Markdown parsing).
- Rename now preselects the filename without its extension, like new-file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Initial release: tabbed, Typora-style WYSIWYG Markdown editor.
- Folder workspace with file-tree sidebar, command palette, outline panel.
- Dark/light themes, session restore, single-instance file association.
- Windows NSIS installer and macOS dmg/zip packaging.
