# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude / AI agents (and new devs) working in this repo. Keep it
short; deep detail lives in [`docs/`](./docs/).

## What this is

**HorseMD** — a warm, Typora-style Markdown editor. Electron shell + Vite +
React, with **Milkdown Crepe** (ProseMirror-based WYSIWYG) as the editor engine.
Core idea: every file opens as a **tab in one window**, not a new process. The
shell (tabs, file tree, command palette, outline, themes, i18n, welcome screen)
is all hand-written.

## Commands

```bash
npm install            # if Electron download is slow: ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
npm run dev            # electron-vite dev (HMR)
npm run build          # build main + preload + renderer → out/
npm start              # run the built app
npm run dist           # build + electron-builder package for the HOST platform
npm run dist:dir       # unpacked build (no installer)
```

`npm run dist` packages for whatever OS you run it on — **Windows NSIS** on
Windows, **macOS dmg + zip** on macOS (a dmg must be built on macOS). If the
electron-builder binaries download slowly:
`ELECTRON_BUILDER_BINARIES_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron-builder-binaries/`.

Builds are **unsigned**: Windows shows SmartScreen ("更多信息 → 仍要运行");
macOS Gatekeeper blocks first launch (right-click → Open, or
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HorseMD.app`).

## Layout

```
src/main/index.js      main process: window, IPC (fs/dialog/watch), menu, file watching
src/preload/index.js   contextBridge → window.api (whitelisted IPC)
src/renderer/src/
  App.jsx              shell: tabs, state, session, theme, lang, welcome, editor routing
  components/Editor.jsx  Crepe wrapper + block controls + enhancements
  components/{Sidebar,Tabs,Outline,CommandPalette,StatusBar,icons}.jsx
  {blocks,themes,i18n,onboarding}.{js,jsx}
  styles/app.css       all styles + theme variables
build/                 icon.ico (Windows) + icon.icns (macOS) + installer.nsh (NSIS uninstall: keep user files)
scripts/               CDP-based e2e helpers (etv.mjs, inspect.mjs)
docs/                  architecture / features / implementation-notes / development
```

## Conventions & rules

- **Cross-platform — do not break the other OS.** This app ships on Windows and
  macOS from one codebase. Platform-specific code is gated:
  - main process: `process.platform === 'darwin' | 'win32'`
  - renderer: `window.api.platform` → an `.app.is-win` / `.app.is-mac` class on
    the root; write platform CSS under those selectors only.
  - title bar: `hiddenInset` + `trafficLightPosition` on macOS (top bar spans
    full width, activity bar drops below the traffic lights). On Windows the
    native `titleBarOverlay` is **disabled** — the renderer draws its own
    minimize/maximize/close buttons (`WindowControls` in `App.jsx`, gated to
    `platform === 'win32'`), driven by `window:*` IPC; main pushes
    `window:maximized` on `maximize`/`unmaximize` so the restore icon stays in
    sync. Keep both paths working when touching the top bar, and always leave a
    draggable area even when tabs fill the strip.
  - shortcuts accept both `Ctrl` and `Cmd` (`metaKey`).
  - launch args: `extractArgs()` in `main/index.js` splits argv into markdown
    **files** (→ `open-paths`, tabs) and **folders** (→ `open-folder`, workspace
    — from the Explorer "Open with HorseMD" folder entry). Keep both handled.
- **Markdown vs plain text.** Supported extensions are centralized:
  `MD_EXTS`/`MD_RE` in `main/index.js` (open dialog + folder scan), and
  `MD_DOC_RE` in `App.jsx`. `.md/.markdown/.mdx` open in the Crepe rich editor;
  `.txt` (and any other file with a path) opens in the **plain textarea** —
  feeding plain text through Milkdown collapses line breaks and hangs on large
  files. New untitled tabs (no path) use the rich editor.
- **ProseMirror view**: get it via `crepe.editor.ctx.get(editorViewCtx)` —
  `crepe.editor.view` is `undefined` in this Milkdown version.
- **Crepe content callback**: register `crepe.on(markdownUpdated)` **before**
  `crepe.create()`, or changes never fire (saves would write stale content).
- **Lazy-mounted editors**: a rich tab's `<Editor>` is created only on its first
  activation, then kept mounted (`mountedIds` in `App.jsx`). This keeps startup /
  session-restore fast (restoring N tabs spins up one editor, not N). Code that
  needs a tab's editor API (`editorApis[id]`) must activate the tab first — see
  `exportPathToPdf`, which opens/activates then waits for `getDocHTML`.
- **Raw HTML rendering**: Milkdown's `html` node shows markup as escaped text;
  we add a ProseMirror node view (`renderHtmlNodeView` in `Editor.jsx`) that
  renders recognized block HTML (e.g. `<table>`) as real, sanitized DOM.
  Display-only — the node round-trips through `attrs.value`, so the saved Markdown
  keeps the original HTML. **Register it by appending to `nodeViewCtx`**
  (`ctx.update(nodeViewCtx, v => [...v, ['html', …]])`), NOT by setting
  `editorViewOptionsCtx.nodeViews` — the core spreads `editorViewOptionsCtx` last
  into the EditorView, so the latter would overwrite every component node view
  (image-block captions, CodeMirror, tables, list items). Same channel Milkdown's
  `$view` uses; see [implementation-notes.md](./docs/implementation-notes.md).
- **Closing the window** warns about unsaved changes: main defers `close`
  (`allowClose` guard) and sends `app-close-request`; the renderer checks dirty
  tabs and calls `confirmAppClose()` to let it close. Covers the macOS traffic
  light, the Windows close button, and Cmd/Ctrl+Q (closing a tab is separate, in
  `closeTab`).
- **App version** is injected at build time via Vite `define` (`__APP_VERSION__`
  in `electron.vite.config.mjs`, from `package.json`); shown on the welcome page.
- **State**: session is `localStorage["minimd.session.v1"]`; onboarding flag is
  `localStorage["horsemd.onboarded.v1"]`; dismissed update notice is
  `localStorage["horsemd.update.dismissed"]`. Themes are `body` classes
  (`light|dark` + optional `theme-*`).
- **Find**: in-document find uses the **CSS Custom Highlight API**
  (`CSS.highlights` + `Highlight`), not `window.find` — it searches only the
  editor body (rich `view.dom` / source `<textarea>`), never UI text, and paints
  ranges without mutating the DOM. See the find helpers in `App.jsx`.
- **Don't commit `dist/` or `out/`** (gitignored). `build/icon.*` IS tracked.

## Testing

No unit tests. Verification is done by running the packaged app and observing
behavior (screenshots), plus the CDP e2e scripts in `scripts/` — see
[`docs/development.md`](./docs/development.md). On macOS, when scripting the dev
build, note that `osascript "tell application \"Electron\""` can launch the
generic `node_modules` Electron bundle (a name collision); prefer testing the
packaged **HorseMD.app**, which has a unique name and bundle id.

## When in doubt

Read the matching doc in `docs/` before changing a subsystem — many non-obvious
behaviors (editor data flow, drag regions, watcher echo suppression, the
title-bar layout) are documented there with their root causes.
