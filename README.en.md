A calm, modern **Markdown editor** — a Typora alternative built around the one
thing Typora gets wrong: **every file opens as a tab in the same window**, not a
new app instance. Browse a whole folder in the sidebar, flip between files in
tabs, and write in a clean WYSIWYG editor.

## Why EasyMarkdown

Most Markdown editors make you choose between a beautiful WYSIWYG canvas and a
real multi-file workflow. EasyMarkdown gives you both: a **single window** that holds
your whole folder in a file tree, every open document in a **tab**, and an
in-place live-preview editor powered by [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/)
(ProseMirror). It runs on **Windows and macOS** from one codebase, and the whole
interface speaks both **English and 中文**.

## Features

**Editing — everything Typora has**

- Seamless **WYSIWYG live preview** — type Markdown, see it render in place
- Slash menu (`/`) for inserting blocks; smart lists, selection toolbar, link tooltips
- Tables (**with in-cell line breaks**), fenced **code blocks with syntax highlighting**, **LaTeX math**, **Mermaid diagrams**, images, task lists, blockquotes
- **Configurable image host** — paste / drop / upload an image and it runs your upload command (Typora-style), inserting the returned URL
- **Source mode** toggle (`Ctrl/Cmd+/`) for raw Markdown — keeps scroll position
- **Plain-text files (`.txt`) open in a fast plain editor** — no markdown reflow, instant on huge files
- Rich-text copy with inline styles (paste into WeChat / email / Notion keeps formatting)
- **Export to PDF** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E`) — clean print layout, no editor chrome
- **Export to HTML** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+H`) — a self-contained single file (local images inlined) that survives mailing / moving
- **System print** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+P`) — the same clean layout straight to the native print dialog
- **Spellcheck** (opt-in, off by default) — toggle in Settings; right-click for suggestions / add to dictionary
- Relative-path images resolve against the file's folder (display only — your file stays untouched)
- **Double-click an image to view it enlarged** in a lightbox (Esc / click to close)
- **Raw HTML tables** (`<table>…</table>` in the Markdown) render as real tables, like Typora — display only, the source is preserved
- A floating **block-level badge** tracks the caret (H1…H6 / Text)

**Beyond Typora**

- **Tabs** — many files in one window (`Ctrl/Cmd+Tab` to cycle); a `+` in the top bar for a new doc; **drag to reorder, right-click to pin** (pinned tabs sit left, survive "Close Others" and restarts); right-click a tab to copy its path / name, reveal it in Finder/Explorer, or close others
- **Split view** — two documents side by side, both editable (right-click a tab → "Open in Split", or the split button in the top bar; close with the ✕ on the right pane)
- **Adjustable editor width** — status-bar presets (Narrow/Medium/Wide/Full) + a fine-tune slider
- **Custom themes** — drop a `.css` into the themes folder; **Typora themes work directly**
- **Unsaved scratch tabs survive a restart** — a new, never-saved doc is still there next time you open EasyMarkdown
- **Folder workspace** — a file tree with create / rename / duplicate / delete / reveal / export-PDF, plus **drag-and-drop to move** and expand-all / collapse-all
- **Open in the same window** — double-clicking a file in Finder/Explorer adds a tab; "Open with EasyMarkdown" on a folder opens it as a workspace
- **Command palette** (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) — fuzzy-jump to any file or command
- **Workspace full-text search** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F`) — search across files with per-file grouping, highlighted hits streaming in as they're found; click to jump to the exact line (case / whole-word / regex)
- **Find & replace in file** (`Ctrl/Cmd+F` / `Ctrl+H`, macOS `⌥⌘F` for replace) — live match highlighting and count, replace one / replace all (case / whole-word / regex apply too)
- **Outline panel** (`Ctrl+Shift+L`) — click a heading to jump
- Live word / character count & reading time
- Session restore — reopens your folder and tabs
- Auto-refreshing file tree & open files — watches for external changes
- **Home button** in the activity bar — back to the welcome page anytime (open tabs stay loaded)
- **Unified Settings** (`Ctrl/Cmd+,`, status-bar gear, or command palette) — typography, appearance, language and editing preferences in one place
- **Autosave** (opt-in, off by default) — saved files write to disk ~2 s after you stop typing; never clobbers an unresolved external edit
- **Choosable default editor** — new Markdown tabs open in keep mode or WYSIWYG, your pick in Settings
- **Manageable recent files** — pin to top, remove one, or clear the list on the welcome page
- **Localized application menu** — the native menu follows the UI language (EN / 中文 / 日本語)
- **Loading skeleton** for large documents, so opening a big file isn't a blank pause
- Unsaved-changes warning when closing the window or quitting (not just closing a tab)
- Notify-only update check — tells you when a new release is out **and shows what changed** (no auto-download)

Command palette — fuzzy-jump to any file or command:

## Themes

Six polished themes — warm light/dark plus four muted **Morandi** palettes —
switchable with `Ctrl+Shift+T` or the status-bar picker.

## Install

Grab the latest installer from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/BND-1/horseMD/releases/latest).

> ℹ️ Builds aren't code-signed yet, so Windows / macOS will warn on first launch — it's **not malware and not actually damaged**. Follow the steps below to allow it. The source is fully open; build it yourself if you prefer.

### 🍎 macOS (step by step)

1. Check your chip: **Apple menu → "About This Mac"**:
   - **"Apple M1 / M2 / M3…"** (Apple Silicon) → download **`EasyMarkdown-x.x.x-arm64.dmg`**.
   - **"Intel"** → download **`EasyMarkdown-x.x.x.dmg`** (the one without the `-arm64` suffix).
2. Double-click the `.dmg` and **drag the EasyMarkdown icon into the Applications folder**.
3. **First launch** (important): double-clicking usually shows **"damaged and can't be opened"** or **"can't verify the developer"** — that's just the missing signature. Use either:

   - **Option A (easiest, recommended)**: in Finder → **Applications**, **Control-click (or right-click) EasyMarkdown → Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog. After this it opens normally by double-click.
   - **Option B (if A still says "damaged")**: open **Terminal** (Launchpad → Other → Terminal), paste this line and press Return:

     ```bash
     xattr -cr /Applications/EasyMarkdown.app
     ```

     then double-click EasyMarkdown again.

> You only need to do this **once per Mac**; updates generally won't require it again.

### 🪟 Windows

1. Download **`EasyMarkdown-Setup-x.x.x.exe`** and run it.
2. If a blue **SmartScreen** "Windows protected your PC" prompt appears, click **More info → Run anyway**.
3. Follow the installer (you can choose the install folder), then launch from Start menu / desktop.

> Signing & notarization are planned — see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).
